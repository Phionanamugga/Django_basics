"""Django Create App
What is an App?
An app is a web application that has a specific meaning in your project, like a home page, a contact form, or a members database.
In this tutorial we will create an app that allows us to list and register members in a database.
But first, let's just create a simple Django app that displays "Hello World!".
Create App
I will name my app members.
Start by navigating to the selected location where you want to store the app, in my case the my_tennis_club folder, and run the command below.
If the server is still running, and you are not able to write commands, press [CTRL] [BREAK], or [CTRL] [C] to stop the server and you should be back in the virtual environment.
py manage.py startapp members
Django creates a folder named members in my project, with this content:
my_tennis_club
    manage.py
    my_tennis_club/
    members/
        migrations/
            __init__.py
        __init__.py
        admin.py
        apps.py
        models.py
        tests.py
        views.py """
